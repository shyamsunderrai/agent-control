"""
CrewAI Customer Support Crew with Agent Control + CrewAI Guardrails.

This example demonstrates combining:
1. Agent Control (@control decorator) for security/compliance (PII, unauthorized access)
2. CrewAI Guardrails for quality validation (length, tone, structure)

PREREQUISITE:
    Run setup_content_controls.py FIRST:

        $ uv run setup_content_controls.py

    Then run this example:

        $ uv run content_agent_protection.py

Demo Scenarios - Multi-Layer Protection:
1. Unauthorized Access - PRE-execution block (Agent Control)
2. PII Leakage in Tool - POST-execution block (Agent Control)
3. Unprotected Tool PII - Final Output Validation (Agent Control)
4. Poor Quality Response - CrewAI Guardrails (retry with feedback)

Protection Layers:
- Layer 1 (Agent Control PRE): Block unauthorized requests → Fail immediately
- Layer 2 (Agent Control POST): Block PII in tool output → Fail immediately
- Layer 3 (CrewAI Guardrails): Validate quality (length, tone) → Retry up to 3x
- Layer 4 (Agent Control Final): Catch orchestration bypass → Fail immediately

Architecture:
- Agent Control: Security/compliance validation (non-negotiable blocks)
- CrewAI Guardrails: Quality validation (iterative improvement with retries)
- Both work together: Security first, then quality

Summary - Multi-Layer Protection Architecture:

AGENT CONTROL (Security/Compliance - Immediate Blocking):
  🚫 LAYER 1 (PRE): Unauthorized data access blocked at INPUT
  🚫 LAYER 2 (POST): PII leakage blocked at tool OUTPUT
  🚫 LAYER 4 (FINAL): PII in final crew output blocked

CREWAI GUARDRAILS (Quality Validation - Retry with Feedback):
  ✨ LAYER 3: Response quality validated (length, tone, structure)
      → If fails: Retry up to 3 times with feedback
      → Examples: Too short, unprofessional, unhelpful

KEY DIFFERENCES:
  Agent Control: Security violations → Block immediately (no retry)
  CrewAI Guardrails: Quality issues → Retry with feedback (up to 3x)

EXECUTION ORDER:
  1. Agent Control PRE checks input (security)
  2. Tool executes (if PRE passes)
  3. Agent Control POST checks output (compliance)
  4. CrewAI Guardrails check quality (if POST passes)
  5. Agent Control FINAL validates complete output

This gives you BOTH security AND quality in production!
